Answer:

Serialization:
Serialization in Java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream.


Deserialization:
The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object.


-The serialization and deserialization process is platform-independent, 
it means you can serialize an object on one platform and deserialize it on a different platform.

-For serializing the object, we call the writeObject() method of ObjectOutputStream class, 
and for deserialization we call the readObject() method of ObjectInputStream class.

-We must have to implement the Serializable interface for serializing the object.

-Serialization mainly used to travel object's state on the network.
