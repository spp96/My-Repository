             -The Statement interface does not allow accepting parameters at runtime.
             -This interface is used when the SQL query is required to be executed only once.
             -The performance of the Statement interface is comparatively not upto the mark.
             -The Statement interface enforces SQL injection.

2) PreparedStatement:-The PreparedStatement interface is used for dynamic SQL statements at run time.
