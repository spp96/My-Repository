Answer:-

If run() method is called directly instead of start() method in Java code, 
run() method will be treated as a normal overridden method of the thread class (or runnable interface)
 This run method will be executed with in the context of the current thread not in a new thread.
 
 Itâ€™s the start() method that spawns a new thread and schedules the thread with the JVM. 
 The JVM will let the newly spawned thread execute run() method when the resources and CPU are ready. 
 So not calling the start method and directly calling the run() 
 method will mean a new thread object is not created and run() method will run as a normal overridden method.
