Answer:-

The main difference between synchronized block and synchronized method is that synchronized block
locks the code within the block whereas synchronized method locks the entire object.


synchronized blocks are more general and synchronized methods can be rewritten to use
synchronized blocks. So if you want to lock the whole object, use a synchronized method. 
If you want to keep other parts of the object accessible to other threads, use synchronized block.
