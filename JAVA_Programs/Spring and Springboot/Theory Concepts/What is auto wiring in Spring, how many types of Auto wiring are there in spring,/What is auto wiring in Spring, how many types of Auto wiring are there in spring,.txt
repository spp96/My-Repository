
  ANS => if spring container injecting all the dependencies implicitly into the dependent class
         this is called "Autowire".

         there are several values for Autowire tag
         1)byName
         2)ByType
         3)Constructor
         we rarely used constructor type

         1)ByName:
         If bean id value in xml file matches the property name of dependent bean then container perform the setter 
         injection into the dependent class.
         If there is no dependencies in that those property value remains null

         2)ByType:
         If bean class in xml file matches the property type  of dependent bean then container perform the setter 
         injection into the dependent class.
         If there is no dependencies in that those propert  type remains null

         3)Constructor:
         In this value of autowire it injects the dependencies using constructor injection not 
         using setter injection mechanism.
