The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.

Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.

Example :-

        class Animal{
        String color = "White";
        }

        class Dog extends Animal{
         String color = "Black";
         void printColor(){
          System.out.println(color); //It will print color of Dog class
          System.out.println(super.color); //It will print color of Animal class

          }
        }

        class Demo{
        public static void main (String [] args){

           Dog d = new Dog(); // we will create obj of Dog class;
           d.printColor();

           }
        }

        Output will get :-
         Black
         White
