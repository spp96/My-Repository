Static Variable :- Static variables can be accessed using class name, it can accessed from both methods static and non-static
                   static variables reduce the amount  of memory used by program. it also shared all among instances of a class.
                   it like global variables which can be available in all methods.

                   Example :-
                   class sample {
                   static int a = 10;
                   }

Non Static Variable :- Non static variables can be accessed using instance of a class, it cannot be accessed inside a static method,
                      it cannot reduce the amount of memory used by program. it only specific to that instance of a class.
                      Non static variable is like a local variable and they can be accessed through only instance of a class.

                      Example :-
                      class sample {
                      int a = 10;

                     }
