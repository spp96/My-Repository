Answer :-

1) Checked_Exception : The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions.
                       For example, IOException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2Unchecked_Exception : The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions.
                       For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, etc.
                       Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.
