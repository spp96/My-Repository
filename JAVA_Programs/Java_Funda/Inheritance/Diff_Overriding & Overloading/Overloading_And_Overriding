Answer : In the method overloading, methods or functions must have the same name and different signatures.
         Whereas in the method overriding, methods or functions must have the same name and same signatures.
         Method overloading is a example of compile time polymorphism.
         Whereas method overriding is a example of run time polymorphism.

         Overloading means creating same name methods inside a class but its parameter types are different.

         Example-->

         void funA(){
         System.out.prinln("Hi this is overloading");

         }

         void funA(int a){
         System.out.prinln("Hi this is overloading but using int (a)");

         }

         Overriding means creating same name method with same parameter types in child class. but inner statements are modified.
         Example-->

         public class Main{
            void funA(){
                System.out.prinln("Hi this is overriding");
            }

         }

         public class Demo extends Main{
            void funA(){
                System.out.prinln("Hi this is overriding statment-1");
                System.out.prinln("Hi this is overriding statment-2");
            }

         }
