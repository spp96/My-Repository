- Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.
- The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.
- An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
- An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".
- A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc
- Example:
  public abstract class Shape{
  public abstract void draw();
  }

2) Interface_class :-
- Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.

- Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
- The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
- An interface can extend another Java interface only.
